> This is a fashion discovery platform. I started off with a working wireframe mock using a pinterest-like board layout, feeding off a RESTful API backend delivering JSON data via AJAX calls, and using infinite scroll to add content to the page as the user scrolls down.

## Reasoning behind technical choices
- jQuery: I needed to download Jquery when I use Angular-bootstrap.
- Angular-bootstrap: For the five start rating, I used ui.bootstrap.rating.
- CSS3: It took care pinterest-like layout and other cool details. 
- Lo-dash: Why Lo-dash? Why not, it is better than Underscore.js!
- Express.js: Hard worker, did all the backend job.
